# ==================== TODO ==================
# - Look into conflict resolution for read/write
#   calendars
# - Possibly allow HTTP calendars to have local
#   changes.
# - Check if common fields between calendars can
#   be defined globaly.

# ==================== Fruux ====================
# Fruux is just some CalDav server I found. In the
# future I plan to host my own. VDirSyncer should
# make this migration fairly simple.
#
# Currently Fruux only tracks one calendar, called
# "Callendar". More calendar can easily be added.
#
# Currently it automaticly finds all calendars there
# and syncs them into directories with UID-names.
#
# I believe that this is better than having one sync
# rule per calendar. Mostly since I wont really be
# looking at the ~/.calendars/ directory manually that
# often.

# ============== LiU Calendars ====================
# The below callendars just fetch from the Calendar
# HTTP server. I can reuppload these to a CalDAV
# server, possibly for syncing them to other places.
#     Currently I however don't see the need for that
# since I just sync these into GoogleCalendar also.
#     Note that these calendars are read only. And
# events should be copied to a private calendar before
# being changed.
