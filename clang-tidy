# Global clang-tidy configuration file.
# clang-tidy works by checking for a `.clang-tidy` file in each
# directory from the directory of the sourcefile, and going up.
#
# This default file is mostly needed due to Ale (vim lsp plugin)
# running on all C files.

Checks:
  # This warning is way to verbose. It dissallows basically functions
  # operating directly on memory regions (e.g. memmove), but also on
  # stuff like fprintf. In their place it recommends functions from
  # Annex K, which (among all other problems) don't even have man
  # pages on my systems!

  # See https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/64027 for further
  # details.
